# multilayer-preceptron-digit-recognizer

This project implements a digit recognition system using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network in C++. 
It's designed to recognize handwritten digits from images, employing neural network architectures and matrix operations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have CMake (version 3.24 or higher) and a compatible C++ compiler that supports at least C++14.

## Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository:** git clone https://github.com/Asafeldman/multilayer-preceptron-digit-recognizer
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** cd multilayer-preceptron-digit-recognizer
3. **Create a build directory and navigate into it:** mkdir build && cd build
4. **Run CMake and build the project:** cmake .. make
5. **Execute the program:** ./digit_recognition_net

## Usage

Run the executable to process the digit images. The system uses pre-trained neural network parameters for digit recognition.
